A global variable is a variable that is accessible from anywhere in the code; it is shared by the whole code.

There's also a number of predefined [local variables]({{< ref "docs/language/variables/local/" >}}).

To start the declaration of global variables, use [`Global`]({{< ref "docs/language/keywords/global" >}}).
