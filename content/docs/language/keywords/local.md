    Local
        [ <local variables> ]
    End

Local is a reserved word used to initiate the declaration of local variables. Terminating the declaration block with an End is needed when the Local is not used in conjunction with the main code of the Program.

For a list of predefined local variables, see [this page]({{< ref "/docs/language/variables/local/" >}}).
