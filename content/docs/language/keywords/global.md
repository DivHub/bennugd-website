    Global
        [ <global variables> ]
    End

Global is a reserved word used to initiate the declaration of global variables. Terminating the declaration block with an End is needed when the Global is not used in conjunction with the main code of the Program.

For a list of predefined global variables, see [this page]({{< ref "/docs/language/variables/global/" >}}).
