    Public
        [ <public variables> ]
    [End]

Public is a reserved word used to initiate the declaration of [public variables]({{< ref "/docs/language/variables/public" >}}). Terminating the declaration block with an [`End`]({{< ref "/docs/language/keywords/end" >}}) is not necessary, but is possible.

## Example

```
Process My_Process();
Public // Declare public variables here
Private
Begin
End
```
