Returns the arccosine of a certain value.

This function performs an arccosine calculation on a certain value and returns an [angle]({{< ref "/docs/variables/angle" >}}) between and including 0 and 180000 (0-180ยบ).

## Parameters

- FLOAT value - The value to be performed an arccosine calculation on.

## Returns

FLOAT : The arccosine result of the specified value, an angle between and including 0 and 180000 (0-180ยบ).

## Notes
